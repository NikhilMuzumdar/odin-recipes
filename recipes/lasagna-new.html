                        alt="Picture of a finished Lasanga">
                    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong> Meat</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound
                            ground pork, ½ pound
                            lean ground beef).</li>
                        <li><strong>Onion</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
                        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed
                            tomatoes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one
                            clove of
                            garlic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong> Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is
                            seasoned with dried
                            basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                        <li><strong>Noodles</strong> Off course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for
                            uncooked noodles,
                            but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cheese</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll
                            also need
                            shredded mozzarella.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding
                            agent (which
                            means they hold the layer together).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking
                            spray. Arrange
                            cauliflower tots evenly in the prepared dish.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and onion; cook, stirring
                            occasionally, until
                            sausage is browned, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli and bell peppers. Cook, stirring
                            occasionally, until
                            vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Spoon mixture over tots in the prepared dish.
                        </li>
                        <li>Whisk together eggs, milk, salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a bowl. Pour evenly over
                            sausage, vegetables,
                            and tots. Sprinkle with Swiss and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, covered with foil, for 20 minutes. Uncover and continue baking
                            until bubbly,
                            about 30 minutes more.</li>

                    <h3 class="major">How to Make Homemade Lasagna</h3>
                    <p>Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe
                        below — but here's a
                        brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Cook the meat</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly.
                            Add the onion
                            and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the
                            parsley,
                            garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
                        <li><strong> Cook the noodles</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until
                            they're al dente.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Make the cheese layer</strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the
                            remaining parsley, the
                            remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
                            (starting with sauce and
                            ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about
                            half an hour.
                            Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="major">How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>
                    <p>In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked in about
                        50 minutes (30-40
                        minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered)</p>

                    <h3>How to Store and Freeze Lasagna</h3>
                    <p>Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight
                        container. Store in the
                        refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.</p>
                    <p>If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow it to cool completely,
                        then tightly wrap
                        the entire dish in storage wrap. Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil.
                        Freeze for up to
                        three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or microwave.</p>

                    <h3>Directions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir
                            until browned and
                            crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt,
                            oregano, and sugar.
                            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
                            lasagna noodles in
                            the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10
                            minutes. Drain and set
                            aside.</li>
                        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and
                            pepper in a large
                            bowl until combined.</li>
                        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish
                            just to to coat
                            it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese
                            mixture, 1/2 of the
                            remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the
                            remaining noodles,
                            cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is
                            golden brown, 5 to
                            10 more minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <p>Feel free to substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese for a more traditional cheese
                        filling. You can also
                        add layers of veggies (such as spinach and mushrooms) when layering your lasagna.</p>
